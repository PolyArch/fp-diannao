# fp-diannao

* This is an extremely simple C version of classifier/convolution dnn kernels, based on data layout and implementation from diannao paper:
http://novel.ict.ac.cn/ychen/pdf/DianNao.pdf

* Data is completely made up, but shouldn't matter for dense kernels.  Datatypes are currently set at fp32; see VTYPE in dnn.h.

* Currently, Makefile is configured for example layers from VGG16.
